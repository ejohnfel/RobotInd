Robot Industries: Universal Python Code Base for my Robotic Work.

Base Development:

Raspberry Pi A+ Model 3
Python 3.10+
Adafruit DC and Stepper Motor HAT for Raspberry Pi (PID 2348)

As I have quite a few robots with various technolgies, I will be adding things as I go along.

Some future items:
Arduino's
Milk V's
Seeed Studio LinkIt's (7681, 7688 [Smart and Smart Duo)
Seeed Studio Xiao's
Seeed Wios... probably
Raspberry Pi Zero W's and other Raspberry Pi's
Probably some Raspberry Pi 2040's
Pyboards (and other Python based MCU's)
Adafruit Trinkets
ESP32 and 8266s
Beaglebones of various types
Wilderness Labs Meadow F7
Onion Omega's

Adafruit Crickit Motor HAT for Raspberry Pi
Adafruit DRV8871 H-Bridges
Adafruit Motor/Stepper/Servo Shield for Arduino

Probably other wierd stuff as I have a lot of old hardware laying about and a number of robot chassis just sitting around.
